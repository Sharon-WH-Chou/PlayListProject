COMMENTS FROM THE INSTRUCTOR:

Such nice work on this project, you two! You have an awesome tester,
and you have a working strategy for removing liked items from the
playlist. (I'm not a fan of altering a for-loop index in the middle
of the loop that way, but it works!)

Oh, also be sure to include JavaDoc comments at the beginning of your
files with File information and @author and @version fields indicated.
People look to see who's responsible for a file there! :)

Overall, excellent work!

SCORE: 20/20
